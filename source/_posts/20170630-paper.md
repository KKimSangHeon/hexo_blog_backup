### A Survey of Fingerprint Indoor Positioning Techniques

#### introduction
The location based service (LBS) industry is so flourishing that enumerating all LBSs available now is almost impossible. In the marketing field, LBSs may recognize the current location of tenta-tive customers and push advertisement messages and coupons to them when they enter a predefined area. When a person makes a call to 911, the location of the person is identified by the emergency response agency so that help can be provided quickly. The location-based information service deliv-ers information of points of interests located near to the user. The navigation service is another well-known type of location-based services.
Location-based service cannot be realized unless the positioning problem is solved. The Global Positioning System (GPS) can be used as a general solution for outdoor positioning. However, posi-tioning for indoor area is still under development. We are especially interested in wireless local area network (WLAN)-based indoor positioning techniques because it is available in almost all huge man made constructions. Most of WLAN-based indoor positioning techniques use either the signal propa-gation model or fingerprints.
Implementation of the signal propagation model based indoor positioning method can be done quickly whereas implementation of the fingerprint method takes a long time. However, the finger-print method is more accurate than the signal propagation model based method. This paper surveys recently published fingerprint indoor positioning techniques.

### Review of the Techniques for Smart Learning Systems

#### introduction
Flipped learning is said to be one of the most efficient teaching and learning methods. In flipped learning, students watch lecture videos at home. In the class, they solve interesting problems under the teacher’s guide. Nowadays, students watch videos through smart devices while they are on the way home. Therefore, schools should provide a smart learning system.
A database of lecture videos, smart applications, content management systems, and streaming servers are essential parts of smart learning systems. There are many database management system (DBMS) with which we can develop database of lecture videos. Among them, this paper reviews techniques to use MySQL DBMS.

### Techniques for Group Management Application Development

#### introduction
A group management system provides many types of valuable services. For example, a teacher can be aware of current locations of all the students in real time during a field trip using a group management mobile application. In the early stage of location based service, fleet management was one of the hottest research topics. This paper reviews group management related research results.
Positioning, handling maps, handling a database and mobile programming are indispensable technologies for the development of fleet management systems. Usages of these technologies in fleet management system development are discussed.

### Survey of Techniques for Location-Based Mobile Campus Guide Systems

#### introduction
Location-based service provides useful information based on the place where the user is located. Smart phones are ideal devices that provide location-based services because they are equipped with various sensors with which we can determine the location of smart phones.
As an example of location-based service, the authors of [1] introduced a campus guide mobile app. This paper surveys techniques needed in development of location-based mobile campus guide systems. Campus guide systems prints out texts and images. It also plays audios and videos. Therefore, video on demand (VOD) techniques will be discussed. Techniques to identify the context of user will also be discussed. Finally, this paper will propose a design of a campus guide
